# neuroevolution_flappybird
## Introduction
This is a course project of Artificial Intelligence.

It use Neuro-evolution to train the AI to run the Flappy Bird. Neuro-evolution is to use genetic algorithm to train the neruo network instead of a classic BP. It could be applicated in reinforcement learning.

In neuro-evolution.py is the code for the neural network, genetic algorithm and neuro-evolution. In game.py, it is mainly the game with the AI in it to play.

The contruct of the project is:

For details, please check the pdf file.

## Result
The highest score is 564369.5 point in 823 generation.

For the total 1200 runs:

## Run the code
You could download the code and run it using the AIs of 1200th generation to see how well the bird flies :)

If you want to train it from zero, please remove lastgeneration.txt

### Packages include
numpy / pygames
